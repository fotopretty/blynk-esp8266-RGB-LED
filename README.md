I found Blynk somewhere in my facebook feeds and it catches my curiosity.

The setup is quite simple:
All I need was
1 x ESP8266 ESP-12F module
1 x USB cable
1 x Android or iPhone mobile
1 x WiFi.

I use a USB cable to program the ESP-12F.

All of the source code is on the github link below.
For my case, i use GPIO12 - Green, GPIO13 - Blue, GPIO15 - RED to control the RGB LED.

Arduino IDE was being used to upload the Blynk firmware.
My module runs at 9600 baud rate.
